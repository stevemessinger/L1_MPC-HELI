# NMPC Adaptive Control of a Micro 3D-Helicopter

## Motivation
This is an implementation of the L1 adaptive model predictive controller used by ETH Zurich onto an autonomous nano 3D helicopter (http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_L1_Drew.pdf). We developed this repository to track the progess of our implimentation of the idea and document the steps needed to get the project operational
